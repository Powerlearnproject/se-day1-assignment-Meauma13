#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of transforming user/business requirements using structured technological approaches into useful applications that drive productivity and and achieves business goals.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:

1. The advancement of programming languages from 1st generation to 6th generation (presently Artificial Intelligence).

2. The advancement of powerful computer hardware with higher CPU and RAM features as well as better improved storage disk drives.

3. The progress from distributed computing to cloud computing, thus enabling software and business applications to be more readily accessible globally without extensive infrastructure costs.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:

1. Analysis/Requirements Phase which deals with gathering and understanding the stated user needs and desired workflow.

2. Algorithm Phase which deals with the breaking-down of the user requirements into actionable parts.

3. Coding Phase which deals with translating the algorithms into software applications.

4. Testing Phase which deals with pre-production and post-production verification that the application performs as intended, as well as identifying errors/bugs for corrective actions.

5. Continuous Maintenance Phase which deals with monitoring of the application, providing updates where necessary and ensuring the life-span of the application.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology is a linear and sequential, where each phase is completed before moving on. It allows for little flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete, customer feedback comes late after the product is developed, and testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile Methodology is iterative and incremental with multiple cycles (sprints), allows for high flexibility as it readily adapts to changing requirements, regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint, and testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer is one tasked with developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks, maintains and updates software to keep it functional, collaborates with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.

A Quality Assurance Engineer is one who collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement, creates development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow, confirms that the software meets the requirements before deployment, analyzes the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.

A Project Manager is one who assembles and leads the software development team, discusses the project and its requirement with the client and software developers, creates a blueprint for the project, tracks and communicates information regarding the project milestones, delivers the complete software to the client and regularly checks its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a complete suite of tools for developing, debugging and deploying software applications. It has features such as intellisense that helps with auto-suggestion of the next programming construct to apply, provides code refactoring as well as syntax/semantic checks to ensurethat the program.runs as intended.

A Version Control System (VCS) is a system which allows for multiple collaborations on software development/maintenance projects, tracks changes to source code and ensures that source code merges are done correctly or easily rolled back in the event of abnormality.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.

Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.


Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.

Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.


Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.

Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.


Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.

Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.


Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.

Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.


Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.

Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

2. Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together, also helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

3. System testing - focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions. It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security.

4. Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. It determines whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person".

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
